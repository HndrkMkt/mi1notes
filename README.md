This is a collection of notes I've been making for the course [Machine Intelligence 1: Supervised Learning](https://www.ni.tu-berlin.de/menue/teaching_activities/all_courses/machine_intelligence_i/) at the TU Berlin. 
Machine Intelligence 1 is the first part of two consecutive courses on topics in machine learning and artificial neural networks taught by Prof. Klaus Obermayer of the [Neural Information Processing Group](www.ni.tu-berlin.de) at TU Berlin.

Topics covered throughout the course: 
* Artificial neural networks
* Learning and generalization
* Deep Learning and Recurrent architectures
* Elements of statistical learning theory
* Kernel Methods
* Bayesian networks
* Reinforcement learning
